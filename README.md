üé¨ Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 

üìã Project Overview
This project builds a content-based movie recommender system using the TMDB 5000 movies and credits dataset. The workflow highlights end-to-end feature engineering, text vectorization, and similarity-based recommendations‚Äîserving as a practical guide for deploying real-world movie recommendation engines.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps & Theory

Data Import & Merging: Load the TMDB movies and credits datasets, then merge them on the movie title for a unified view of metadata.

Data Cleaning & Filtering: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and filter relevant columns such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview for focused modeling.

Feature Engineering:

Parse JSON-like metadata fields using custom logic for genres, keywords, top cast, and directors.

Normalize and tokenize text data to ensure consistency.

Combine processed fields into a single tags column, representing consolidated movie metadata.

Text Processing:

Convert all tags to lowercase and apply stemming to reduce dimensionality and harmonize textual data.

Use scikit-learn‚Äôs CountVectorizer to extract key features and build numerical representations.

Similarity Computation:

Calculate cosine similarity on the feature vectors, allowing efficient retrieval of similar titles.

Recommendation & Deployment:

Implement a recommender function that fetches top-5 most similar movies by analyzing content similarity.

Serialize datasets and the similarity matrix for rapid deployment and future use.

‚ú® Key Highlights

End-to-End Content-Based Pipeline: From data merging to real-time recommendations, the workflow adheres to best machine learning practices.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Custom parsing and normalization of multi-valued movie metadata for richer recommendations.

Natural Language Processing: Automated text cleaning (lowercasing, stemming, stop word removal) for robust feature extraction.

Efficient Similarity Search: Fast recommendations using vectorized cosine similarity.

üèÅ Conclusion
This solution offers a complete blueprint for movie content-based recommendation systems, from raw text data to API-ready deployments. It demonstrates a solid foundation in data preprocessing, NLP for feature extraction, and similarity search‚Äîmaking it ideal for both educational and production-grade movie recommendation applications.
